### CPSC 120

* Lab 3

    Lab 3, part 3 was one of my favorites because it was our first time using if and else if statements. I had used it in the past with other languages so I had a general idea of what I was supposed to do. I was really happy when I was able to successfully write the code correctly first try. Coding this project helped me learn the basic formats of if statements, which is really important for future projects. 
* Lab 5

    Lab 5, part 3 was another really fun project because we made our own game of blackjack. Blackjack has always been a fun game that I would play from time to time and I thought that it was really cool being able to make a simple version of it. This project taught me how to add up all the card numbers and check if any cards had different values depending on the current score.

* Lab 10

    Lab 10, part 3 was really interesting because it was our first time making an image. It was really different from all the other projects that we have done and now we are creating other stuff, not just programs. This project taught me how to use magick++, which I had a lot of fun learning.
